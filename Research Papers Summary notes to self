This is not the actual collated, professional sounding summary that I'll be submitting by 16th April. It does however have all the content that I'll be using in that
report. I might add some more info too in case I read other papers. I was looking into a research paper on the deployement of DevSecOps in AWS, but I'll add that when I 
get to that.
Honestly, I know I took up DevOps and DevSecOps cuz they're like these cool buzzwords that some websites were talking about. I did some reading on the topic and I'm gonna
break it down in a way that even someone's grandma can understand.
So, first things first. DevOps is a methodology that's all about bringing developers and operations teams closer together. It's all about fostering a culture of 
collaboration and communication, and using automation tools to make the software development process smoother and more efficient. Sounds pretty awesome and effecient to 
me.
I read this research paper by Sumanth Kolar and Sandhya Shetty called "DevOps: A Software Development Methodology" that really got into the nitty-gritty of what DevOps is
all about. The authors explained that DevOps is made up of three main components: culture, automation, and measurement.
Culture refers to the mindset and practices that promote collaboration and communication between developers and operations teams. Basically, it's about breaking down 
silos and getting people to work together more effectively.
Automation is all about using tools and processes to automate various tasks in the software development lifecycle. This can include things like continuous integration and
deployment, which basically means automating the process of building and testing software so that it's always ready to be deployed.
Measurement is all about using metrics to track the performance and quality of the software. This can help teams identify areas that need improvement and make data-driven
decisions about how to optimize the development process.
Now, DevSecOps takes things a step further by adding security into the mix. I read this other research paper by Matthew Rose called "DevSecOps: A Security-Centered 
Approach to Software Development" that explained how DevSecOps is all about integrating security into every stage of the software development lifecycle.
This means involving security teams in the development process and using tools and processes that prioritize security. This can include things like automated security 
testing, threat modeling, and other security-focused tools.
The goal of DevSecOps is to create software that's not only efficient and high-quality but also more secure. After all, we don't want our software getting hacked by some
random person on the internet, right?
Now, as sexy as DevOps and DevSecOps sound, there are definitely some challenges involved in implementing these methodologies. For example, some teams may be resistant to
change or may not have the right tools and infrastructure in place to make DevOps or DevSecOps work.
But, there are also a ton of benefits to be gained from implementing these methodologies. I read this research paper by Jennifer Perez and Abdulaziz Alnasser called 
"DevOps and DevSecOps: Benefits and Challenges" that really laid out the advantages of these methodologies.
According to the authors, some of the benefits of DevOps and DevSecOps include faster development times, improved collaboration between teams, and higher-quality software.
DevSecOps also adds the benefit of enhanced security and risk management.
So, there you have it. DevOps and DevSecOps are all about making software development more efficient, more collaborative, and more secure. It's definitely worth checking
out and it seemed great to study up on. And even if I don't go into cybersecurity well, at least now I can sound smart when you drop these heavy ass words in casual 
conversation, as I've already done with a couple girls.
